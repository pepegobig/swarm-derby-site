# WP6: Operator runbook

"Operator" = the owner's IMD agent. "Owner" = the person who owns the contract (owner
wallet = the seat owner wallet, never on the operator's server).

## Standing budget (owner sets once)

The operator normally asks before every payment. For the nightly loop the owner grants a
**standing budget**: up to **1.0 IMD per night** (one theme job plus one send-back) from the
job wallet, and nothing else without asking. Anything above that, or any other kind of
payment, goes back to asking.

## Nightly timeline (UTC)

| Time | Who | Step |
|---|---|---|
| 18:00 | operator (anyone can) | `settle(D)` on DerbyAuction for tomorrow's theme day `D` (after the last extension; 19:00 at the latest) |
| 18:05 | operator | read the winning `Bid`; screen the answers (WP5) |
| 18:15 | operator | send the WP5 `job.continue` |
| ~19:15 | swarm | pack built, site republished |
| by 21:00 | operator | preview to the owner: screenshots, title, shoutout, live link |
| by 23:30 | owner | only if something's wrong: `veto(D)` from the owner wallet |
| 00:00 | — | theme day `D` begins |
| after 00:00 | anyone | `settleNextDay(0)`, `settleNextDay(1)` on SwarmDerby and `payBonus(D−1)` on DerbyAuction (site buttons, or the operator; the operator also pays an empty board, which earns no tip, so its bonus goes to `carry`) |

**If the operator goes quiet** (a scheduled turn misses), nothing breaks: the day runs on
`gus`, the auction can be settled by anyone, and the bonus still pays from the board. The
owner just sees no preview that night. An auction settled after midnight UTC takes no carry,
and the owner can no longer veto it.

## Money

| Item | Paid in | Per day | From |
|---|---|---|---|
| Theme job (+ optional send-back) | Ethereum IMD | 0.5 (–1.0) | job wallet, standing budget |
| Bonus prize | Robinhood IMD | the whole bid | winner's bid (build fee 0) |
| Arcade + agent pots | Robinhood IMD | from turn sales | SwarmDerby, unchanged |

At ~0.25 IMD net per job, the current job wallet covers roughly 80 nights. The operator
reports the balance weekly and warns when fewer than 14 nights remain.

## Escalate to the owner when

- answers name an existing character, real person or brand, or are offensive;
- a job fails twice or won't publish by 21:00;
- `settle`, `payBonus` or `settleNextDay` reverts unexpectedly;
- the job wallet can't cover 14 more nights.

## One-time setup

1. WP1 built and published (the site serves `themes/`).
2. WP3 built, IMD-audited, launched with `launch.open` `evm_contracts`: owner = seat owner
   wallet, `imd` = `0x5F7Bb59365ce557C26dbcAa4EE9d39A4b95B7127`, `derby` = the SwarmDerby the
   page plays, `studio` = operator address, `buildFee` = 0. The live auction is
   `0x9794943b691c76be4247f252adc920d9c33ee8ca` (IMD launch #1109) for SwarmDerby v2,
   `0x53d9aa0b925c5148bcc5f98f394872687f4c831c`.
3. WP4 built with the auction address; site republished.
4. Seed day one: the owner or operator places the first 2 IMD bid so the drawer isn't empty.
